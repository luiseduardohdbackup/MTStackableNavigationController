## 0.3.0

* Add ability to reveal the next-to-top controller in the stack
* Tweak how far controllers need to be panned to pop / end a reveal
* Start using MTCollectionOperators for set operations internally

## 0.2.0

* Switch to MIT license
* Gesture support
* Lots of internal refactoring to more clearly separate maintenance of the view
  controller hierarchy from the on-screen view hierarchy. The code should be
  much cleaner, easier to read, and easier to keep in sync with
  UINavigationController as a result

## 0.1.0

* Initial release
